      Hi, my name is Arno Sonck, I am from MÃ©xico and right now I am learning to
      code in Python to used on data science.


      My dream is to work in a laboratory doing research on AI and robotics. My
      profesional experience is related to mechanical design and manufacturing
      while my academic studies ara related to no-linear control focused on
      observer design.


      At the present I am a teacher of physics, statistics and computation so,
      feel free to ask any related question, I may not have the answer but I can
      find it.
