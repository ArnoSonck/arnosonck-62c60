First of all, the following lines are just my opinion, so they are very likely to be biased by some kind of romanticism. Even though, I’ll do my best to be objective.

What is the **core of art**? To me, the core is the artists, the way they find and transmit related ideas is what made an artist. It doesn’t maters if the message is transmitted by a painting, by a poem, or even by a movie. They are in constant need of living different experiences so their vision of the world gets wider. In that sense, they are like scientists, both, **artists and scientists**, are in a constant **journey of knowledge**, experimenting with the world and sharing their findings. An artist can be a scientist when figuring out how to say something and a scientist can be an artist when creating a theory or an experiment.

So, is there any **breach** at all **between an Artist and a scientist**? I think there is but, at the same time, there isn’t. Once a piece of knowledge is consolidated, it is supposed to be repeatable, the same procedure must lead to the same results. The ideal treatment for any sickness should lead to a healthy state. This means that creativity is supposed to be less needed. The reality is that, while some areas are full of very defined rules and procedures that lead to very knows results, there are many others that aren’t. Medicine is one of these gray areas. To diagnose, there should be a standard procedure, this doesn’t mean that the diagnose is right 100% of the time.

To end with, I would like to point out that science also reaches an end each time a piece of knowledge is consolidated. So, at least to me, art and science are together in the same journey of discovery and sharing. 

Now it is your turn, tell me, what is art to you? what is science to you? is there only one way to understand the world around us?
