## Introduction

Statistics is the terror of many teenagers since it is taught without context or situations that are not related to theirs daily life nor the life they are dreaming to achieve. As a consequence, statistics became a subject that only evaluates the ability to make systematic calculations.

## A possible solution

In order to present statistics as a powerful tool for decision-making, it is necessary to define practical situations, like sports, artists, or even politics. Using an example of a factory filling jars is quite boring and makes statistics look like something that is only for work. On the other hand, not everything can be funny or interesting, but you can make it necessary. For example, a student’s dream job can be in the filling jars “boring” factory working with robots that need maintenance, so calculating the probability of a failure related to time or use becomes fundamental.

## Use software

Hand calculation is essential to develop cognitive abilities, however, they will hardly beat a computer in velocity or precision. It is wise to also teach how to use specialized software as Excel or Python focused on data science. This way, your students will be able to really use statistics and focus on understanding the meaning of the measures, as central tendency and variation.

## Conclusion 

It doesn’t maters If you are a teacher, professor, or student, statistics is beautiful when you truly understand it.
